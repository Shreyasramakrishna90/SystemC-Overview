Feedback

1) Good readme and explanation of the architecture, and graphs.

2) Good use of random number generator to simulate the drop times. However, what is the purpose of using two random generators? What happens if you use a larger random time in your first use case.

3) Good use of threads to listen and evaluate. Only suggestion would be, you could truncate the output of time.time().

Very good!!!
